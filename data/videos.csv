06:20:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157713,food-interest.png,x,Learning to\nForage,Learning to Forage,"<p>Baby monkeys learn what to eat and how to eat it by closely watching the adults, and trying to imitate them.</p><p>Capuchins have a complex diet &mdash; some of their foods require some complicated processing, like cracking open nuts, removing itchy hairs, or neutralizing scorpion stings.  There are also many poisonous plants and animals in the jungle &mdash; the babies learn what to eat and what to avoid from the adults.</p><p>Scientists believe that the monkeys' complicated diet provided a pressure for monkeys to evolve big brains.</p>"
07:05:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157733,play.png,x,Play,Play,"<p>Play is important for the monkeys to practice their motor skills and strengthen their friendships.  It's a favorite passtime for the juveniles, but sometimes the adults join in too.</p>"
07:12:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/78042995,hair-in-mouth.png,x,Games,Hair-in-Mouth Game,"<p>The <i>hair-in-mouth</i> game: one monkey bites a wad of hair out of the other's face, and holds it in between his teeth.  The other monkey immediately gets to work trying to remove the hair from the monkey's mouth.  This game can continue for a long time, sometimes up to 30 minutes &ndash; the monkeys biting out several tufts of hair and passing them back and forth between their mouths.</p><p>The monkeys have been seen playing several other variations of this &ldquo;game&rdquo; prying fingers out of each other's mouths, and extracting &rdquo;toys&ldquo like sticks, leaves, or bark.</p><p>Interestingly, each group has its own set of games that it plays, different from the other groups.  When monkeys migrate from one group to another, sometimes they have been observed introducing games from their old group into their new group.  Could this be a primitive form of culture?</p>"
07:10:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/78042100,eyeball-poking.png,x,Eyeball\nPoking,Eyeball Poking,"<p>Some of the monkeys love this activity: grabbing a friends hand, and poking your own eyeball with your friend's finger &mdash; they seem totally mesmerized.  It appears awfully uncomfortable, but the monkeys seem to love and crave this activity.</p><p>In addition to eyeball poking, the monkeys play other unpleasant-seeming &ldquo;games&rdquo; like sticking their fingers up each other's noses, biting hair out of each other's faces, and cupping their hands in front of each other's mouths.  So why do they do it?</p><p>The answer, according to extensive research by scientists at the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project, appears to be that it helps the monkeys build trust.  If you trust me not to scratch your eyeball out, then you can trust me to support you in squabbles.  <span class=”parens”>(The monkeys play these &ldquo;games&ldquo; only with their closest friends &mdash; pairs that spent more time grooming each other were more likely to play these relationship-testing games.)</span></p>"
08:25:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157754,food-peep.png,x,Foraging,Foraging,"<p>Capuchin monkeys spend nearly their entire day <i>foraging</i> &mdash; on the move, looking for their next snack, traveling an average of about 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) each day.</p><p>Most of the calories in their diet come from fruit, and the monkeys need to keep a detailed mental map of all of their favorite fruit trees and food sources in the forest.  Researchers hypothesize that this need for mental map-keeping helped to drive the evolution of primate intelligence.</p><p>In this video, you can hear monkeys making <i>food-peep</i> vocalizations &mdash; the monkeys make this sound when they're excited about finding their favorite foods.  They sound cute, but research shows that the monkeys are probably actually making these food-peep sounds to claim the foods as their own and tell the other monkeys to back off.</p>"
08:14:20,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157723,sniff-scent.png,x,Smell,Smelly Communication,"<p>Monkeys communicate via smell &mdash; we have only scratched the surface of understanding their world of smell-based, or <i>olfactory</i>, communication.  They will often sniff each other's urine - they smell for pheromones, hormones, and other chemicals which tell them who's ovulating, who's pregnant, who's stressed out, and all kinds of other things that we don't know about.</p><p>Capuchins often rub their own urine into their fur to cover themselves with the scents.</p>"
08:13:15,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157748,sex-dance.png,x,Sex\nDance,Sex Dance,"<p>This video shows a sex dance: two monkeys pace back and forth while fixing their gaze on one another and vocalizing with rhythmic exchanges grunts, wheezes and squeaks. They often exhibit ""duck faces"" and ""twists/turns"" in which they spin part or all of their bodies while making duck faces at the dance partner. These dances frequently lead up to a copulation (conceptive or non-conceptive). Any age-sex combination except for dorsal infants can engage in sex dances.</p><p>Monkeys use sex for a variety of purposes: reproduction, conflict resolution, social bonding, and assertion of dominance.</p><p>In the observational data here, one of the adult males, Tom Jerry, is sex dancing with baby Winslow Homer.  This might be a way for Tom Jerry to show off his dominance &mdash; because the males are competing with each other for mates, they will sometimes try to stop each other from sex-dancing.  So sex-dancing can be a form of social aggression and showing off: &ldquo;I'm stronger than you!  You can't stop me from sex-dancing!&rdquo;</p>"
08:45:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157732,pound.png,x,Food\nProcessing,Food Processing,"<p>Here, a monkey is pounding a Luchea fruit to knock out the tasty seeds.</p><p>It takes several years for the juvenile monkeys to master all of the complex foraging techniques required by the monkeys' diet.  The babies try out all kinds of different ways to get the seeds out of the Luchea fruit, before eventually becoming fixed on just one technique that they'll use for their whole adult life.  The babies carefully watch the adults processing the fruits, and try to imitate them.</p><p>Scientists hypothesize that <i>extractive foraging</i> techniques, used by many species of monkeys, were a key driving force for the developent of their intelligence, requiring enhanced sensorimotor coordination and manual dexterity.  <span class=""parens"">(Some species use tools for foraging, an even more complex mental tasks.  White-faced capuchins, though, have not often been observed using tools.)</span></p>"
