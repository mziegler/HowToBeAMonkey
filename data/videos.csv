06:20:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157712,food-interest.png,x,Learning to\nForage,Learning to Forage,"<p>Baby monkeys learn what to eat and how to eat it by closely watching the adults, and trying to copy them.</p><p>Capuchins have a complicated diet.  Some of their foods require tricky processing, like cracking open nuts, removing itchy hairs, or avoiding stings.  There are also poisonous plants and animals in the jungle &mdash; the babies learn what to eat and what to avoid from watching the adults.</p><p>Scientists believe that the monkeys' complicated diet provided a pressure for monkeys to evolve big brains.</p>"
07:05:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157733,play.png,x,Play,Play,"<p>Play is important for the monkeys to practice their motor skills and strengthen their friendships.  It's a favorite passtime for the juveniles, but sometimes the adults join in too.</p>"
08:13:15,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157748,sex-dance.png,x,Sex\nDance,Sex Dance,"<p>This video shows a sex dance: two monkeys pace back and forth while fixing their gaze on one another and vocalizing with rhythmic exchanges grunts, wheezes and squeaks. They often exhibit ""duck faces"" and ""twists/turns"" in which they spin part or all of their bodies while making duck faces at the dance partner. These dances frequently lead up to a copulation (conceptive or non-conceptive). Any age-sex combination except for the youngest infants can engage in sex dances.</p><p>Monkeys use sex for a variety of purposes: reproduction, conflict resolution, social bonding, and assertion of dominance.</p><p>In the observational data here, one of the adult males, Tom Jerry, is sex dancing with baby Winslow Homer.  This might be a way for Tom Jerry to show off his dominance &mdash; because the males are competing with each other for mates, they will sometimes try to stop each other from sex-dancing.  So sex-dancing can be a form of social aggression and showing off: &ldquo;I'm stronger than you!  You can't stop me from sex-dancing!&rdquo;</p>"
08:14:20,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157723,sniff-scent.png,x,Smell,Smelly Communication,"<p>Monkeys communicate via smell &mdash; we have only scratched the surface of understanding their world of smell-based, or <i>olfactory</i>, communication.  They will often sniff each other's urine - they smell for pheromones, hormones, and other chemicals which tell them who's ovulating, who's pregnant, who's stressed out, and all kinds of other things that we don't know about.</p><p>Capuchins often rub their own urine into their fur to cover themselves with the scents.</p>"
08:25:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157754,food-peep.png,x,Foraging,Foraging,"<p>Capuchin monkeys spend nearly their entire day <i>foraging</i> &mdash; on the move, looking for their next snack, traveling an average of about 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) each day.</p><p>Most of the calories in their diet come from fruit, and the monkeys need to keep a detailed mental map of all of their favorite fruit trees and food sources in the forest.  Researchers hypothesize that this need for mental map-keeping helped to drive the evolution of primate intelligence.</p><p>In this video, you can hear monkeys making <i>food-peep</i> vocalizations &mdash; the monkeys make this sound when they're excited about finding their favorite foods.  They sound cute, but research shows that the monkeys are probably actually making these food-peep sounds to claim the foods as their own and tell the other monkeys to back off.</p>"
08:45:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157732,pound.png,x,Food\nProcessing,Food Processing,"<p>Here, a monkey is pounding a Luchea fruit to knock out the tasty seeds.</p><p>It takes several years for the juvenile monkeys to master all of the complex foraging techniques required by the monkeys' diet.  The babies try out all kinds of different ways to get the seeds out of the Luchea fruit, before eventually becoming fixed on just one technique that they'll use for their whole adult life.  The babies carefully watch the adults processing the fruits, and try to imitate them.</p><p>Scientists hypothesize that <i>extractive foraging</i> techniques, were a key driving force for the developent of primate intelligence, requiring enhanced sensorimotor coordination and manual dexterity.  <span class=""parens"">(Some species use tools for foraging, an even more complex mental task.  White-faced capuchins, though, have not often been observed using tools.)</span></p>"
10:36:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157716,undulating-scream.png,x,Fights,Fights,"<p>Capuchin monkeys have hot tempers &ndash; they sometimes get into squabbles over food and social status.</p><p>The monkeys usually settle their disputes with communication signals like screams, grunts, coalition/alliance postures, and displays of strength like shaking branches.  Physical fights can leave monkeys badly injured, even if they win.  Therefore the monkeys have excellent motivation to avoid them, and instead they first try to settle their differences with their repertoire of communication signals before the stakes get too high.</p>"
11:00:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157728,headflag.png,x,Coalitions,Coalitions and Social Rank,"<p>An angry monkey here makes a <i>headflag</i> gesture, jerking his head to try to recruit a friend into a coalition.</p><p>Coalitions are hugely important to capuchins' social status, and they need detailed understandings of each other's relationships in order to be successful politicians.  In a fight, monkeys will most often solicit help from an audience member who outranks their opponent.  The monkeys are also more likely to seek help from someone with whom they are better friends than their opponent.  They're always keeping tabs on each other's relationships, so they can leverage them to their advantage.</p><p>For females, coalitionary behavior mostly supports the existing hierarchy.  The female's social hierarchy is more stable than the males, but major shifts in power can still occur when alliances change.</p><p>For any of the new males (<i>Tom Jerry</i>, <i>King Donkey</i>, <i>Pope John</i>, and <i>King James</i>) to overthrow Duende and become the alpha male, they'll need to win support from the other group members.  Duende, meanwhile, is busy trying to strengthen his own relationships so he can hold on to his alpha-male position.</p>"
13:34:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/78042995,hair-in-mouth.png,x,Games,Hair-in-Mouth Game,"<p>The <i>hair-in-mouth</i> game: one monkey bites a wad of hair out of the other's face, and holds it in between his teeth.  The other monkey immediately gets to work trying to remove the hair from the his friend's mouth.  This game can continue for a long time, sometimes up to 30 minutes &ndash; the monkeys biting out several tufts of hair and passing them back and forth between their mouths.</p><p>The monkeys have been seen playing several other variations of this &ldquo;game&rdquo; prying fingers out of each other's mouths, and extracting &rdquo;toys&ldquo; like sticks, leaves, or bark.</p><p>Interestingly, each group has its own set of games that it plays, different from the other groups.  When monkeys migrate from one group to another, sometimes they have been observed introducing games from their old group into their new group.  Could this be a primitive form of culture?</p>"
13:33:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/78042100,eyeball-poking.png,x,Eyeball\nPoking,Eyeball Poking,"<p>Some of the monkeys love this activity: grabbing a friends hand, and poking your own eyeball with your friend's finger.</p><p>They look totally mesmerized.  It appears awfully uncomfortable, but the monkeys seem to love and crave this activity.</p><p>In addition to eyeball poking, the monkeys play other unpleasant-seeming &ldquo;games&rdquo; like sticking their fingers up each other's noses, biting hair out of each other's faces, and cupping their hands in front of each other's mouths.  So why do they do it?</p><p>The answer, according to extensive research by scientists at the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project, appears to be that it helps the monkeys build trust.  If you trust me not to scratch your eyeball out, then you can trust me to support you in squabbles.  <span class=”parens”>(The monkeys play these &ldquo;games&ldquo; only with their closest friends &mdash; pairs that spent more time grooming each other are more likely to play these relationship-testing games.)</span></p>"
14:25:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157757,snake-alarm.png,x,Snake\nAlarm,Snake Alarm!,"<p>The monkeys work together to defend themselves against predators &mdash; having many pairs of eyes to watch out is one of the main advantages of living in a group.</p><p>The monkeys have different <i>alarm call</i> vocalizations for different predators - a call for snakes (monkeys run up,) a call for birds of prey (monkeys run down,) and a call for big mammals like ocelots.  After spotting a predator that relies on surprise, like a snake, the monkeys essentially render the predator harmless.</p><p>The males often make a big show of threatening the snake with teeth-showing, squeak threats, and coalitions to impress the lady monkeys.  Look at me ladies!  So big and strong!</p>"
14:45:00,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157718,fur-rubbing.png,x,Fur\nRubbing,Social Fur Rubbing,"<p>This is one of the most entertaining capuchin behaviors to watch.  When the monkeys find a particularly noxious plant, like chili peppers, citrus fruits, or guapinol tree sap, instead of eating it they start to frantically rub it all over their fur.  In a big frenzied pile of writhing monkeys, they rub it all over each other and take special care to rub it onto the babies who are too young to do it themselves.  They rarely get so excited about anything else.</p><p>Why do they do this?  Nobody knows for sure.  Researchers hypothesize that the chemicals in these plants help to keep insects away, though they haven't been able to prove it yet.</p><p>This behavior seems to be at least partially instinctual instead of entirely learned, because captive capuchins have been observed rubbing their fur with noxious plants that they have never seen before.</p>"
13:45:10,https://player.vimeo.com/video/104157717,friendly-climb.png,x,Alloparenting,Alloparenting,"<p>Aunt Dante is a frequent babysitter of Winslow Homer.  Female capuchin monkeys, and the males to a lesser extent, are obsessed with all of the babies in the group, always eager to play with them and take care of them.  Female capuchins will even nurse babies other than their own surprisingly often, considering that milk takes a lot of energy to produce.</p><p>This behavior, taking care of infants other than your own, is called <i>alloparenting</i> among primate researchers.  Capuchin monkeys exhibit much more alloparenting than most other monkey species, and capuchin moms are quite permissive with their babies, letting them wander around the group.</p><p>In many other monkey species, it's been demonstrated that high-ranking moms are much more permissive with their infants, while low-ranking moms are more restrictive and protective of their babies.  If your baby gets into trouble with another monkey in the group, a high-ranking mom can simply go retrieve her baby and reprimand the trouble maker, but a lower-ranking mom might not be able to take her baby back.  There have been cases of &ldquo;aunting to death&rdquo;, where babies have been stolen from moms by female monkeys who are not producing milk, and the babies have starved to death.</p><p>So why are female monkeys so obsessed with babies other than their own, instead of focusing their energy only on their own babies?  There are several hypothesis.  Alloparenting might serve as practice for motherhood: parenting skills are more learned than instinctual.  First-time mothers can be clumsy, and experience with other babies will help you take care of your own when the time comes.  It's been demonstrated in a wide range of species that each subsequent offspring of a mother are more likely to survive than the previous &ndash; practice helps.</p><p>It's also possible that the monkeys use babysitting as a way to curry favor with an infant's mother &ndash; females in some species are more likely to mate with males who are frequent alloparents of their babies.  A third hyopthesis is the &ldquo;byproduct effect&rdquo; where females are wired to find their own babies so irrisistibly cute that they can't resist other babies either.</p>"
