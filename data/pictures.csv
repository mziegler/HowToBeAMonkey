06:52:00,DT-grooming.jpg,x,Grooming,Grooming,"<p>Winslow Homer is being groomed his aunt Dante.  Grooming is an important way for monkeys to strengthen their social bonds, by helping each other out.  They comb through each other's fur, picking out insects and other parasites &mdash; a tasty snack!</p><p>For the monkeys, it's very important to have good friends in the group.  Having allies helps them get better food, take better care of their babies, and win fights.</p><p>Grooming goes &ldquo;up the social hierarchy&rdquo;: the low ranking monkeys spend much more time grooming the high-ranking monkeys.  Winslow Homer is the alpha female's baby, so everybody wants to groom him!</p>"
09:16:00,Dali.jpg,x,Parenting,Parenting,"<p>Winslow Homer's mom, Dali, is the alpha female of the group.  For the first couple years of their lives, young monkeys spend most of their time around their mothers <span class=”parens”>(This picture shows her carrying Winslow Homer on her belly.)</span></p><p>Winslow gets most of his nutrition from his mother's milk.</p><p>The other monkeys are eager to take care of Winslow, groom him, and play with him to gain Dali's favor.</p>"

10:47:00,DU_DT.jpg,x,Coalitions,Coalitions,"<p>Duende and Dante are not happy to see you.</p><p>White-headed capuchin monkeys are known for forming lots of <i>coalitions</i>, to communicate who sides with whom.  They have many different postures to show off their coalitions - sometimes one monkey will climb on another's back (shown in the picture), sometimes one will put its arm around the other monkey's shoulders, and sometimes they'll stand with their cheeks pressed together.</p><p>Coalitions count for a lot in capuchin society.  If you're big and strong, you can easily win a one-on-one fight with most other monkeys in the group.  But if several monkeys gang up on you, you're helpless.</p>"

06:41:52,SEP_KST_IGO.jpg,x,Researchers,Researchers,"<p>The observations you see on this map are real data collected by scientists!  Researchers follow Winslow Homer from the ground.  They use a system of codes to collect complex data about the monkeys' social behavior, which they use for statistical analysis.</p><p>There are so many questions to ask!  Why did monkeys evolve to be so smart?  How do their complex social lives work?  What kinds of challenges do they face in their environments?  How are they similar to us humans, and how are they different?</p><p>The scientists also collect poop samples to non-invasively measure the monkey's hormones.  From this data we can measure their stress levels, their reproductive cycles, and a host of other information.</p>"

12:30:00,TJ-coalition.jpg,x,Coalitions,,"<p>Here are Tom Jerry and Winslow Homer in a coalition stance.  (Winslow looks a little confused.)</p><p>Coalitions are important for strengthening the monkey's friendships, especially for the males, who groom each other less than the males.  The monkeys form coalitions against all kinds of stuff: other monkeys, human researchers, food, snakes, and even their own poop.</p><p>Yeah!  Look at us!  We're on a team!</p>"
07:50:00,DA_AS.jpg,x,Alpha\nFemale,Alpha Female,"<p>Winslow Homer's mom, Dali, is the alpha female of the group.  She's quite politically savvy: she's popular among the other monkeys and they often turn to her for help in conflicts.</p><p>Adult females usually inherit the rank of their mothers.  Babies watch their mother's interactions with other monkeys, and learn to behave the way she behaves.  If your mother is high-ranking and confident, you'll learn to act high-ranking and confident &ndash; and if your mother is low-ranking and skittish, you'll learn to act low-ranking and skittish.  In capuchin monkeys, females stay in the same group their whole lives, and social hierarchies tend to be stable over the years.</p>"
15:42:00,wasps.jpg,x,Wasps,Chaser Wasps,"<p>Researchers had to pause collecting data about Winslow Homer for half an hour, starting at <i>3:42 PM</i>, because the monkeys disturbed a chaser wasp nest <span class=""parens"">(so named because they'll buzz behind you and sting you as you run away.)</span>  The stings don't seem to bother the monkeys much; they have an unbelievable pain tolerance.</p></p>Wasps are a frequent headache for the scientists.  The Lomas Barbudal Biologial Reserve was originally created as a reserve for tropical wasps, with an estimated 25% of all recorded wasp species in the world.  For some reason, the angry chaser wasps always seem to go for your head!</p>"

07:15:30,DU.jpg,x,Alpha\nMale,Alpha Male,"<p>Winslow Homer's dad, Duende, is the alpha male of the group.</p><p>In capuchin society, there's a lof pressure to be the alpha male &ndash; <i>the alpha male typically fathers more than 80% of all the babies in the group!</i></p><p>Male ranking is mostly determined by strength and body size, but males can also climb to the top of the social ladder through alliances with other males.  Males migrate to a new group once they reach adulthood, and male social structures can be quite volatile.  It's always easy to pick out the alpha male in a group of capuchins, because he puffs up his fur to look bigger than all the other males.</p><p>Duende is a bit of a scaredy-cat.  The researchers studying this group are surprised that Duende has managed to hold onto his position for so long!</p>"
