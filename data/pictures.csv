05:45:00,sunrise.jpg,x,Still\nDark,Still Dark,<p>It's still too dark to collect data about the monkeys.</p><p>The  researchers at the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project usually start their day around <i>4:00AM</i> - they have to get to the monkeys before they wake up!  Grumble grumble</p>
06:25:00,food-interest.jpg,x,Food\nInterest,Food Interest,"<p>Winslow Homer closely watches King Donkey eat his fruit.</p><p>As far as we can tell, capuchin monkeys have not been observed actively &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; new skills to the babies, but they are very tolerant of the babies' intrusive observations, and sometimes let them steal some food.</p>"
06:41:52,SEP_KST_IGO.jpg,x,Researchers,Researchers,"<p>The observations you see on this map are real  behavior observation data, collected by scientists!  Researchers trudge through the jungle every day, following the monkeys from the ground.  They use a system of codes to collect complex data about the monkeys' social behavior, which they statistically analyze to uncover a trove of exciting information about these critters.</p><p>There are so many questions to ask!  Why did monkeys evolve to be so smart?  How do their complex social lives work?  What kinds of challenges do they face in their environments?  How are they similar to us humans, and how are they different?</p>"
06:52:00,DT-grooming.jpg,x,Grooming,Grooming,"<p>Here we see Winslow Homer being groomed his aunt Dante.  Grooming is an important way for monkeys to strengthen their social bonds, by helping each other out.  They comb through each other's fur, picking out insects and other parasites &mdash; a tasty snack!</p><p>For the monkeys, it's very important to have good friends in the group.  Having allies helps them get better food, take better care of their babies, and win fights.</p><p>Grooming goes &ldquo;up the social hierarchy&rdquo;: the low ranking monkeys spend much more time grooming the high-ranking monkeys than vice-versa.  (High-rankers also spend more time grooming each other than low-rankers.)</p><p>Winslow Homer is the alpha female's baby, so everybody wants to groom him.  Lucky guy!</p>"
07:15:30,DU.jpg,x,Alpha\nMale,Alpha Male,"<p>Winslow Homer's dad, Duende, is the alpha male of the group.</p><p>In capuchin society, there's a lof pressure to be the alpha male &ndash; <i>the alpha male typically fathers more than 80% of all the babies in the group!</i></p><p>Male ranking is mostly determined by strength and body size, but males can also climb to the top of the social ladder through alliances with other males &mdash; male social hierarchies can be quite volatile at times.  It's always easy to pick out the alpha male in a group of capuchins, because he puffs up his fur to look bigger than all the other males.</p><p>Duende is a bit of a scaredy-cat.  The researchers studying this group are surprised that Duende has managed to hold onto his position for so long!</p>"
07:31:00,WH-FN.jpg,,Play,,"Winslow Homer plays with <b>Frankenstein</b>, the only other infant in the group this year.  Play helps the monkeys form social bonds and learn motor skills."

07:50:00,DA_AS.jpg,x,Alpha\nFemale,Alpha Female,"<p>Winslow Homer's mom, Dali, is the alpha female of the group.</p><p>She's a savvy politician: Dali is quite popular among the other monkeys and they often turn to her for help in conflicts.</p><p>Female monkeys usually inherit the rank of their mothers.  Babies watch their mother's interactions with other monkeys, and learn to behave the way she behaves.  If your mother is high-ranking and confident, you'll learn to act high-ranking and confident &ndash; and if your mother is low-ranking and skittish, you'll learn to act low-ranking and skittish.</p><p>In capuchin monkeys, females stay in the same group their whole lives, and social hierarchies tend to be stable over the years.</p>"

08:55:00,WH_KY.jpg,x,Insects,Eating Insects,"<p>Winslow Homer munches on a katydid.  Capuchin monkeys get most of their protein from insects; they're expert insect hunters.  They're particularly fond of acacia ants, caterpillars, stinkbugs, and giant grasshoppers.</p>"
09:10:00,Dali.jpg,x,Parenting,Parenting,"<p>This picture shows Dali, the alpha female, carrying baby Winslow Homer on her belly.</p><p>Birth seems relatively easy for capuchin mothers, at least when compared to humans.  When a baby is first born, interestingly, neither the mother nor any of the other monkeys give much attention to it for the first week of its life.  The new baby spends it's time sleeping and nursing, and the new mom goes on with her business as if she didn't have a baby at all &ndash; the baby is capable from birth of grasping onto her fur and riding under her belly for 24 hours a day, so she has full use of her ams and legs while carrying the baby around.</p><p>A week into its life, suddenly the baby's face changes color, and the new mom and the rest of the group suddenly become obsessively curious about the baby.  This unusual phenomenon may be explained by the fact that in capuchins a large proportion of brain development takes place after birth, relative to other primate species except humans and chimps.</p><p>At this stage, it doesn't take long before the baby becomes everso inquisitive and starts to interact with the world around it.  Everybody in the group loves to play with babies: at his age, Winslow Homer is the center of everybody's attention!</p><p>Winslow gets most of his nutrition from his mother's milk.  He's not very good at foraging on his own yet, and milk remains an important part of a baby monkey's diet until they're about 2 years old.  Milk prodution takes a lot of energy, so Dali has to eat quite a lot.  For females it's important to have a high social rank, because high-rankers get the best-quality food!</p><p>Female capuchins are usually either nursing or pregnant for their whole lives once they reach adulthood; they don't have a menopause like humans.</p>"
10:47:00,DU_DT.jpg,x,Coalitions,Coalitions,"<p>Duende and Dante are not happy to see you.</p><p>White-headed capuchin monkeys are known for forming lots of <i>coalitions</i>, to communicate who sides with whom.  They have many different postures to show off their coalitions - sometimes one monkey will climb on another's back (shown in the picture), sometimes one will put its arm around the other monkey's shoulders, and sometimes they'll stand with their cheeks pressed together.</p><p>Coalitions count for a lot in capuchin society.  If you're big and strong, you can easily win a one-on-one fight with most other monkeys in the group.  But if several monkeys gang up on you, you're helpless.</p>"
11:01:00,AA-siesta.jpg,,Naps,,"Nap time!.  The capuchins spend most of their time on the move, but take a siesta every now and then.  The adults take time to rest, groom, and sleep, while the babies and juveniles play."
12:30:00,TJ-coalition.jpg,x,Coalitions,,"<p>Here are Tom Jerry and Winslow Homer in a coalition stance.  (Winslow looks a little confused.)</p><p>Coalitions are important for strengthening the monkey's friendships, especially for the males, who groom each other less than the males.  The monkeys form coalitions against all kinds of stuff: other monkeys, human researchers, food, snakes, and even their own poop.</p><p>Yeah!  Look at us!  We're on a team!</p>"
13:11:00,bromeliad.jpg,x,Fruit,,"Winslow Homer munching on a bromeliad fruit!  Fruit makes up most of the calories in the monkeys' diet, and the monkeys spend the bulk of their day eating."

15:42:00,wasps.jpg,x,Wasps,Chaser Wasps,"<p>Researchers had to pause collecting data about Winslow Homer for half an hour, starting at <i>3:42 PM</i>, because the monkeys disturbed a chaser wasp nest <span class=""parens"">(so named because they'll buzz behind you and sting you as you run away.)</span>  The stings don't seem to bother the monkeys much; they have an unbelievable pain tolerance.</p><p>Wasps are a frequent headache for the scientists.  The Lomas Barbudal Biologial Reserve was originally created as a reserve for tropical wasps, with an estimated 25% of all recorded wasp species in the world.  For some reason, the angry chaser wasps always seem to go for your head!</p>"

17:00:00,WH_WE.jpg,x,Resting,,"Winslow Homer resting.  Capuchin monkeys don't tend to sleep much during the day, but they occasionally take naps."
14:00:00,DT-coati.jpg,x,Meat,Meat,"<p>Dante has caught a baby coati!  A tasty snack.  (A coati is a small mammal, a bit like a racoon.)</p><p>Monkeys don't get to eat meat too often, so this is quite a lucky day.  The other monkeys will undoubtedly try to steal some of her treat, and she'll have to defend her kill so she can have the nutrition for herself.  Meat-sharing has been studied by primatologists in other species: monkeys sometimes strategically share meat to gain political favors.  It's a scarce and highly sought-after commodity.</p>"

14:30:00,howler.jpg,x,Howlers,Howler Monkeys,"<p>These capuchins share their habitat with one other species of monkey: the howlers.</p><p>Capuchins love to bother Howlers when they find them.  They chase them, gang up on them, and pull their tales.  Capuchins, in general, are obnoxious to all kinds of other animals in the jungle, and seem to harass them just for the fun of it.</p><p>Why are capuchins so annoying to other animals?  Maybe it benefits them because other animals learn to stay away from them, or maybe it has a team-building effect for the capuchins.</p><p>Howler monkeys are astoundingly lazy.  They barely move, but their diet is mostly leaves so they have no need: they have abundant food all over the place.  They spend most of their time sleeping.</p><p>Howlers are famous for their extremely loud vocalizations.  (Unfortunately for the researchers, there is a group of howlers that likes to sleep right next to camp.)</p>"

15:20:00,poop.jpg,x,Poop,Poop,"<p>Never set your bag down under a good pooping branch!</p><p>The researchers are avid collectors of monkey poop, which reveals all kinds of exciting information</p><p>Non-invasive DNA samples from poop help us piece together the monkeys' family tree.  Measuring the hormone cortisol tells us when monkeys are experiencing stress, and we can measure prolactin and progesterone to track the female's reproductive cycles.  From poop we can also learn about the digestive process, and the evolutionary relationship between the monkeys and the plants whose seeds they disburse.</p>"
