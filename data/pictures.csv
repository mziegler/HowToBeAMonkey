06:52:00,DT-grooming.jpg,x,Grooming,Grooming,"<p>Winslow Homer is being groomed his aunt Dante.  Grooming is an important way for monkeys to strengthen their social bonds, by helping each other out.  They comb through each other's fur, picking out insects and other parasites &mdash; a tasty snack!</p><p>For the monkeys, it's very important to have good friends in the group.  Having allies helps them get better food, take better care of their babies, and win fights.</p><p>Grooming goes &ldquo;up the social hierarchy&rdquo;, the low ranking monkeys spend much more time grooming the high-ranking monkeys than vice versa.  Winslow Homer is the alpha female's baby, so he gets quite a lot of attention!</p>"
07:50:00,Dali.jpg,x,Parenting,Parenting,"<p>Winslow Homer's mom, Dali, is the alpha female of the group.  For the first couple years of their lives, young monkeys spend most of their time around their mothers <span class=”parens”>(This picture shows her carrying Winslow Homer on her belly.)</span></p><p>Winslow gets most of his nutrition from his mother's milk.</p><p>The other monkeys are eager to take care of Winslow, groom him, and play with him to gain Dali's favor.</p>"

12:41:00,TJ-coalition.jpg,x,Coalitions,Coalitions,"White-headed capuchin monkeys are known for forming lots of coalitions, when they signal to the other monkeys that they're on a team together.  They use several different postures to show their coalitions - sometimes one monkey will climb on another monkey's back, sometimes one will put its arm around the other monkey's shoulders, and sometimes they'll stand with their cheeks pressed together.  In addition to scaring off predators and other monkies, the coalitions help the monkeys reinforce their social bonds."

06:41:52,SEP_KST_IGO.jpg,x,Researchers,Researchers,"<p>Researchers follow Winslow Homer from the ground.  They use a system of codes to collect complex data about the monkeys' social behavior, which they use for statistical analysis.  The observations you see on this map are real data collected by scientists!</p><p>There are so many questions to ask!  Why did monkeys evolve to be so smart?  How do their complex social lives work?  What kinds of challenges do they face in their environments?  How are they similar to us humans, and how are they different?</p><p>The scientists also collect poop samples to non-invasively measure the monkey's hormones.  From this data we can measure their stress levels, their reproductive cycles, and a host of other information.</p>"

15:42:00,wasps.jpg,x,Wasps,Chaser Wasps,"<p>Researchers had to pause collecting data about Winslow Homer for half an hour, starting at <i>3:42 PM</i>, because the monkeys disturbed a chaser wasp nest <span class=""parens"">(so named because they'll buzz behind you and sting you as you run away.)</span>  The stings don't seem to bother the monkeys much; they have an unbelievable pain tolerance.</p></p>Wasps are a frequent headache for the scientists.  The Lomas Barbudal Biologial Reserve was originally created as a reserve for tropical wasps, with an estimated 25% of all recorded wasp species in the world.  For some reason, the angry chaser wasps always seem to go for your head!</p>"
