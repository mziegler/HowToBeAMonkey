05:45:00,Still\ndark,Still dark,x,<p>It's still too dark to collect data about the monkeys.</p><p>The  researchers at the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project usually start their day around <i>4:00AM</i> - they have to get to the monkeys before they wake up!  Grumble grumble</p>
06:55:00,Primate\nintelligence,Primate intelligence,x,"<p>How did monkeys evolve to be so smart?  What were the environmental factors that pushed them?  There are 3 main hypothesis, and they all probably played a role.</p><ol><li><i>Social skills</i>: Monkey groups have complex social structures, made up of friendships, fights, deceptions, and alliances to navigate.  Within-group and between-group competition creates huge rewards for socially-smart monkeys. The monkeys in a group are always watching each other, keeping tabs on each other's relationships.</li><li><i>Learning and imitation</i>: many species of monkeys specialize in complicated foods that take a couple steps of processing, like cracking open nuts or disabling a scorpion's stinger.  The baby monkeys don't know these complex foraging techniques instinctually, they have to learn them by watching the adults.</li><li><i>Ecological intelligence</i>: monkeys, especially species who specialize in eating fruit, need good spatial memory to keep track of the locations of important food resources.  Some species make use of tools for foraging, though tool-use has not often been observed in white-faced capuchin monkeys.</li>"
09:52:00,Group\nlife,Group life,x,"<p>Winslow Homer lives in a group with 31 monkeys, of different ages and sexes.</p><p>Almost all species of monkeys live in social groups.  Some advantages to group life are:<ol><li><i>More effective monopolization of resources</i>: by teaming up with a group of other monkeys, it's easier to claim and defend food resources like your favorite fig tree, and keep other groups away.  <span class=”parens”>(But now you have competition within your group!)</span></li><li><i>Safety from predators</i>: your group has more eyes and ears to watch out for potential threats.</li><li><i>Access to mating partners</i>: when you're out living by yourself, mating partners can be hard to find.</li></ol></p>"
10:01:00,Group\nstructures,Group structures,,"<p>The structures of monkeys' social groups varies widely by species. <ol><li>Some species have stable groups that don't change much over time, while some are frequently splitting and joining new groups.</li><li>In some species, females stay in their birth group and males migrate to a new group once they reach adulthood <i>(matrilineal)</i>, while in some species the males stay in their birth group and females stay.  In some species, both sexes migrate.  This helps to prevent inbreeding.</li><li>In some species monkeys have a single mate for life <i>(monogamy)</i>, but in most species the monkeys have many mates <i>(promiscuity)</i>.</li><li>Some species have groups with only one adult male, while species have many males in each group.</li><li>Group sizes vary between species.  Some species, like Gibbons, have small groups (4-6 monkeys), while some species like Geladas have huge groups with hundreds of monkeys.</li></ol></p><p>Capuchins have stable, matrilineal, promiscuous, multi-male groups, usually with about 15-25 monkeys.  <span class=”parens”>Migrating males also sometimes form all-male groups of just a few monkeys, looking for a stable multi-male multi-female group to join.</span></p>"
11:21:00,Nursing,Nursing,,"<p>Winslow Homer still gets most of his nutrients from his mother Dali's milk.</p><p>The adult females have to eat quite a lot to get the nutrients they need for pregnancy and nursing.  Most females continuously remain either nursing or pregnant for the rest of their lives once they reach sexual maturity - they don't have a menopause like humans.</p><p>High ranking females in the group get the best food, so it is important to develop good social skills.</p>"
13:41:00,Alloparenting,Alloparenting,x,"<p>Capuchin monkeys, especially the young females love to play with babies.  Caring for other capuchin babies, called <i>alloparenting</i>, helps them practice,  learning how to take better care of their own babies.  Winslow Homer is one of only 2 babies in the group this year, so he gets quite a lot of attention!</p>"
14:11:00,Eating\ninsects,Eating insects,,"<p>The capuchins get most of the protein in their diet from eating insects - they're expert insect hunters.  They're fond of acacia ants, caterpillars, stinkbugs, and giant grasshoppers.</p><p>Most monkeys become highly skilled at raiding wasp nests at an early age &mdash; they have an extrordinary pain tolerance and the stings don\'t bother them too much.</p>"
16:11:00,Predators,Predators,x,"<p>The monkeys work together to defend themselves against predators &mdash; having many pairs of eyes to watch out is one of the main advantages of living in a group.</p><p>The monkeys have different <i>alarm call</i> vocalizations for different predators - a call for snakes (monkeys run up,) a call for birds of prey (monkeys run down,) and a call for big mammals like ocelots.</p><p>After spotting a predator that relies on surprise, like a snake, the monkeys essentially render the predator harmless.  The males often make a big show of threatening the predators to impress the ladies.</p>"
07:22:00,Social\nRank,Social Rank,x,"<p>Winslow Homer's parents are the two most high-ranking monkeys in the whole group: <b>Dali</b> the <i>alpha-female</i>, and <b>Duende</b> the <i>alpha-male</i>.</p><p>Social rank affects many parts of a capuchin monkey's life.  The monkeys compete with each other, within their own social group, for the highest-quality food and for access to mates &mdash; high-ranking monkeys get access to the best resources.</p><p>Adult females usually inherit the rank of their mothers.  Babies watch their mother's interactions with other monkeys, and learn to behave the way she behaves.  If your mother is high-ranking and confident, you'll learn to act high-ranking and confident &ndash; and if your mother is low-ranking and skittish, you'll learn to act low-ranking and skittish.  In capuchin monkeys, females stay in the same group their whole lives, and social hierarchies tend to be stable over the years.</p><p>Male ranking is mostly determined by strength and body size, but sometimes males can climb to the top of the social ladder through alliances with other males.  Males migrate to a new group once they reach adulthood, and male social structures can be quite volatile.  There's a lot of pressure to be the alpha male &ndash; <i>in capuchin monkeys, the alpha male typically fathers more than 80% of all the babies in the group!</i></p>"
12:31:00,Male\nMigrations,Male Migrations,x,"<p>When male capuchin monkeys reach adulthood, around 7 years old, they leave their social group and migrate to a new group.  This helps to prevent inbreeding.</p><b>King James</b>, <b>King Donkey</b>, <b>Pope John</b>, and <b>Tom Jerry</b> have recently migrated into Winslow Homer's social group.  Winslow and the other juvenile males will leave the group once they reach adulthood.</p><p>Migrating males are not always successful in joining a new group.  Males will try to keep new males from migrating into their groups, because more males means more competition for mates.  The females don't want new males joining the group either, because it's much safer when the males have stable relationships then when the males are fighting for social position.</p><p>Migration is a dangerous time for the males: many of them get injured or die when trying to join a new group.  Migrating males will sometimes form small all-male groups, and try to take over a large male-female group together.  Strong friendships and <i>coalitions</i> are crucial for their success.</p><p>In capuchin monkeys, females usually stay in the group where they were born for their whole lives.  Interestingly, this is the opposite from most new-world monkey species, where females migrate and males stay in their birth group.</p>"
