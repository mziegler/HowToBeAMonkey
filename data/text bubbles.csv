06:42:00,Behavioral\nEcology,Behavioral Ecology,x,"<p>These researchers study monkeys through the lens of <i>Behavioral Ecology</i>.  Behavioral ecology is the study of animal behavior as an evolutionary adaptation, in response to conditions of the environment.  </p><p>Which environmental factors caused the evolution of these different primate behaviors?</p>"
06:55:00,Primate\nintelligence,Primate intelligence,x,"<p>How did monkeys evolve to be so smart?  What were the environmental factors that pushed them?</p><p>There are 3 main hypotheses, and they all probably played a role.</p><ol><li><b>Social skills</b>: Monkey groups have complex social structures, made up of friendships, fights, deceptions, and alliances to navigate.  Competition with their other group members creates huge rewards for socially-smart monkeys. The monkeys in a group are always watching each other, keeping tabs on each other's relationships.</li><li><b>Extractive foraging</b>: many species of monkeys specialize in complicated foods that take several steps of processing, like cracking open nuts or disabling a scorpion's stinger.  The baby monkeys don't know these complex foraging techniques instinctively, they have to learn them by watching the adults.</li><li><b>Ecological intelligence</b>: monkeys, especially species who specialize in eating fruit, need good spatial memory to remember the locations of important food resources.  Some species make use of tools for foraging, though tool-use has not often been observed in white-faced capuchin monkeys.</li>"
07:22:00,Social\nRank,Social Rank,x,"<p>Winslow Homer's parents are the two highest-ranking monkeys in the whole group: <b>Dali</b> the <i>alpha-female</i>, and <b>Duende</b> the <i>alpha-male</i>.</p><p>Social rank affects many parts of a capuchin monkey's life.  The monkeys compete with each other, within their own social group, for the highest-quality food and for access to mates &mdash; high-ranking monkeys get the best resources.</p>"
09:52:00,Group\nlife,Group life,x,"<p>Winslow Homer lives in a group with 31 monkeys, of different ages and sexes.</p><p>Almost all species of monkeys live in social groups.  Some advantages to group life are:<ol><li><i>More effective monopolization of resources</i>: by teaming up with a group of other monkeys, it's easier to claim and defend food resources like your favorite fig tree, and keep other groups away.  <span class=”parens”>(But now you have competition within your group!)</span></li><li><i>Safety from predators</i>: your group has more eyes and ears to watch out for potential threats.</li><li><i>Access to mating partners</i>: when you're out living by yourself, mating partners can be hard to find.</li></ol></p>"
10:01:00,Group\nstructures,Group structures,,"<p>The structures of monkeys' social groups varies widely by species. <ol><li>Some species have stable groups that don't change much over time, while some are frequently splitting and joining new groups.</li><li>In some species, females stay in their birth group and males migrate to a new group once they reach adulthood <i>(matrilineal)</i>, while in some species the males stay in their birth group and females migrate <i>(patrilineal)</i>.  In some species, both sexes migrate.  This helps to prevent inbreeding.</li><li>In some species monkeys have a single mate for life <i>(monogamy)</i>, but in most species the monkeys have many mates <i>(promiscuity)</i>.</li><li>Some species have groups with only one adult male, while other species have many males in each group.</li><li>Group sizes vary between species.  Some species, like Gibbons, have small groups (4-6 monkeys), while some species like Geladas have huge groups with hundreds of monkeys.</li></ol></p><p>Capuchins have stable, matrilineal, promiscuous, multi-male groups, usually with about 15-25 monkeys.  <span class=”parens”>Migrating males also sometimes form all-male groups of just a few monkeys, looking for a stable multi-male multi-female group to join.</span></p>"
10:12:00,Male\nMigrations,Male Migrations,x,"<p>When male capuchin monkeys reach adulthood, around 7 years old, they leave their social group and migrate to a new group.  This helps to prevent inbreeding.</p><b>King James</b>, <b>King Donkey</b>, <b>Pope John</b>, and <b>Tom Jerry</b> have recently migrated into Winslow Homer's social group.  Winslow and the other juvenile males will leave this group once they reach adulthood.</p><p>Migrating males aren't always successful.  Males try to keep out new males out of the group, because more males means more competition for mates.  The females don't want new males joining the group either, because it's much safer when the males have stable relationships instead of fighting for social position.</p><p>Migration is a dangerous time for the males: many of them get injured or die when trying to join a new group.  Migrating males sometimes form small all-male groups, and try to take over a large male-female group together.  Strong friendships and <i>coalitions</i> are crucial for their success.</p><p>In capuchin monkeys, females usually stay in the group where they were born for their whole lives.  Interestingly, this is the opposite from most new-world monkey species, where females migrate and males stay in their birth group.</p>"
15:30:00,Intergroup\nEncounters,Intergroup Encounters,,"<p>Winslow Homer's group didn't encounter any other capuchin groups today, but they often cross paths with another group who lives nearby.  Capuchins don't have territories that they defend like some other animals do, but they have home ranges that sometimes overlap with other groups, competing for some of the same resources.</p><p>During an intergroup encounter, usually the bigger group chases the other group away.  The females of the losing group grab their babies and take off running right away, and the males make threats, displays, and sometimes fight with each other before the males of the losing group run off after the females.</p><p>Sometimes the monkeys will sneak off and mate with members of the other group, and sometimes the young males will use these encounters as a chance to size up their chances of migrating into the other group.</p>"
16:30:00,Wild vs.\nCaptive,Wild vs Captive Studies,x,"<p>There are two ways to study monkeys: in the wild, and in captivity.  They each have their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>At the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project, we study wild monkeys in their natural habitat.  Using the techniques pioneered by Jane Goodall, we observe them interacting with their environment in the ways that they've gotten so good at over thousands of years of evolution.  We try to interfere with them as little as possible, so it's impossible to conduct controlled experiments to establish cause and effect.</p><p>The main advantages of captive studies is that you can conduct experiments with control groups to establish cause and effect in your research, and you have more control over the monkey's environments &mdash; you can use captive studies to ask some questions about primates that are impossible with wild studies.  Captive studies raise some ethical questions though: can we provide a good quality of life for the captive monkeys?  What happens to the captive monkeys once the study is over?  Fortunately, major improvements have been made in quality of life for captive research monkeys over the past decades, like more enriched, stimulating environments; efforts to keep them together with their friends and families; and better attention paid to their health.</p>"
13:53:00,Habituation,Habituation,x,"<p>These capuchins are <i>habituated</i> to human observers, meaning that they are used to having humans around, and mostly act as they normally would without humans watching them.  (In practice, this means that somebody had to chase them for weeks until they lost their fear of humans.)</p><p>The researchers make extensive efforts to interact with the monkeys as little as possible, so not to change the monkeys' behavior.  It's very difficult to know, though, what impact the observers are having on the monkeys (if any.)</p>"
