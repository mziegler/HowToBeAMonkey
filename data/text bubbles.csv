05:56:00,Still dark,"It's still dark when the monkeys first start moving, and the researchers can't usually collect any data for the first hour or so until the light gets better and it's easier to tell the monkeys apart."
12:31:00,Grooming,"<p>Capuchin monkeys spend a lot of time grooming each other.  Grooming helps to re-enforce the monkey's friendly social bonds, as well as keeping parasites out of their fur.</p><p>Grooming tends to go &ldquo;up the social hierarchy,&rdquo; &ndash; lower-ranking monkeys usually spend much more time grooming higher-ranking monkeys, to gain social favor.  Winslow Homer is Dali the alpha female's son, so everybody is always eager to groom him!</p>"
07:21:00,Travel and foraging,"<p>Capuchin monkeys spend nearly their entire day <i>foraging</i> &mdash; on the move, looking for their next snack, traveling an average of about 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) each day.</p><p>Most of the calories in their diet come from fruit, and the monkeys need to keep a detailed mental map of all of their favorite fruit trees and food sources in the forest.  Researchers hypothesize that this need for mental map-keeping helped to drive the evolution of primate intelligence.</p>"
11:21:00,Nursing,"<p>Winslow Homer still gets most of his nutrients from his mother Dali's milk.</p><p>The adult females have to eat quite a lot to get the nutrients they need for pregnancy and nursing.  Most females continuously remain either nursing or pregnant for the rest of their lives once they reach sexual maturity - they don't have a menopause like humans.</p><p>High ranking females in the group get the best food, so it is important to develop good social skills.</p>"
08:56:00,Learning to forage,"<p>Winslow Homer gets most of his nutrients from his mother Dali's milk, but at this age he's busy learning how to forage for himself by watching the other monkeys in his group.  Many of the monkeys\' foraging skills, like cracking open nuts, take years to master.</p><p>The monkeys' diet presents cognitive challenges &mdash; the monkeys need to know how to find their sparsely-distributed food, and much of their diet is made up of tricky items that have to be bludgeoned, torn apart, disarmed, or killed.</p>"
14:11:00,Eating insects,"<p>The capuchins get most of the protein in their diet from eating insects - they're expert insect hunters.  They're fond of acacia ants, caterpillars, stinkbugs, and giant grasshoppers.</p><p>Most monkeys become highly skilled at raiding wasp nests at an early age &mdash; they have an extrordinary pain tolerance and the stings don\'t bother them too much.</p>"
05:36:00,Early start,<p>The capuchin researchers at the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project usually start their day around <i>4:00AM</i> - they have to get to the monkeys' before they wake up!  Grumble grumble</p>
13:41:00,Alloparenting,"<p>Capuchin monkeys, especially the young females love to play with babies.  Caring for other capuchin babies, called <i>alloparenting</i>, helps them practice,  learning how to take better care of their own babies.  Winslow Homer is one of only 2 babies in the group this year, so he gets quite a lot of attention!</p>"
16:11:00,Predators,"<p>The monkeys work together to defend themselves against predators &mdash; having many pairs of eyes to watch out is one of the main advantages of living in a group.</p><p>The monkeys have different <i>alarm call</i> vocalizations for different predators - a call for snakes (monkeys run up,) a call for birds of prey (monkeys run down,) and a call for big mammals like ocelots.</p><p>After spotting a predator that relies on surprise, like a snake, the monkeys essentially render the predator harmless.  The males often make a big show of threatening the predators to impress the ladies.</p>"
08:11:00,Smelly communication,"<p>Monkeys communicate via smell &mdash; we have only scratched the surface of understanding their world of smell-based, or <i>olfactory</i>, communication.  They will often sniff each other's urine - they smell for pheromones, hormones, and other chemicals which tell them who's ovulating, who's pregnant, who's stressed out, and all kinds of other things that we don't know about.</p><p>Capuchins often rub their own urine into their fur to cover themselves with the scents.</p>"
15:41:00,Chaser wasps,"<p>Researchers had to pause collecting data about Winslow Homer for half an hour, starting at <i>3:42 PM</i>, because the monkeys had disturbed a chaser wasp nest &mdash; so named because they\'ll buzz behind you and sting you as you run away.  Wasps are a frequent pain for the researchers &mdash; the Lomas Barbudal Biologial Reserve was originally created as a reserve for tropical wasps, with an estimated 25% of all recorded wasp species in the world.  For some reason, the angry chaser wasps always seem to go for your head.</p>"
