        For about twelve hours nearly every day in the tropical dry rainforests of northern Costa Rica, researchers at the <b>Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project</b> follow groups of wild capuchin monkeys to observe their behavior.  Since Dr. Susan Perry started studying this population in 1990, researchers have been continuously, meticulously collecting many differenty types of data about the monkeys, including their foraging and social behaviors, hormone levels (from fecal samples) and genetics.  Such detailed long-term observation of these wild monkeys can help us answer questions about the evolution of primate intelligence.

        <b>Winslow Homer</b> is a baby monkey in a study group of wild capuchins called <b>Abby's group</b>.  Some of the researchers followed Winslow Homer all day on January 24, 2014, and you can see some of the data that they collected on this map.  You can get a glimpse into the life of a baby capuchin monkey, and learn about some of the data that the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project collects every day!

        This map is a work in progress!  We're still making design improvements, and we still have data from Winslow Homer Day that we haven't added to the map yet, including some pictures, videos, and stories.  You can keep track of our progress <a href="https://github.com/mziegler/WinslowHomerDay/commits/master" target="_blank">here</a>.
