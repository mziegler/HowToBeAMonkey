Female capuchin monkeys (and the males to a lesser extent) are obsessed with all of the babies in the group, always eager to play with them and take care of them.  Female capuchins will even nurse babies other than their own surprisingly often, considering that milk takes a lot of energy to produce.  This behavior, taking care of infants other than your own, is called <i>alloparenting</i> among primate researchers.</p><p>Why are female monkeys so obsessed with babies other than their own, instead of just focusing their energy on their own babies?  There are several hypotheses.  Alloparenting might serve as practice for motherhood: parenting skills are more learned than instinctual.  First-time mothers can be clumsy, and experience with other babies will help you take care of your own when the time comes.  It's been demonstrated in a wide range of species that each subsequent offspring of a mother are more likely to survive than the previous &ndash; practice helps.</p><p>It's also possible that the monkeys use babysitting as a way to curry favor with an infant's mother &ndash; females in some species are more likely to mate with males who are frequent alloparents of their babies.  A third hypothesis is the &ldquo;byproduct effect&rdquo; where females are wired to find their own babies so irresistibly cute that they can't resist other babies either.</p><p>Capuchin monkeys exhibit much more alloparenting than most other monkey species, and capuchin moms are quite permissive with their babies, letting them freely wander around the group.</p><p>In many other monkey species, high-ranking moms are more permissive with their infants, while low-ranking moms are more restrictive and protective.  If your baby gets into trouble with another group-member, a high-ranking mom can simply go retrieve her baby and reprimand the trouble maker, but a lower-ranking mom might not be able to take her baby back.  There have been cases of &ldquo;aunting to death&rdquo;, where babies have been stolen from moms by female monkeys who are not producing milk, and the babies have starved to death.</p><div class=\"data-note data-note-i\">Click <i>parenting</i> icons on the map for observational data about babysitting.</div>", "thumb": "friendly-climb.png"}]};
